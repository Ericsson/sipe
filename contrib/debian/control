Description: Pidgin plugin for connect to LCS/OCS
 SIP is a popular VoIP protocol that contains a IM (Instant Messenger)
 subprotocol called SIP/SIMPLE. SIP/SIMPLE is an open protocol with a
 documented specification.
 . 
 MSN's Live Communication Server (LCS) is very similar to the
 SIP/SIMPLE protocol but diverges from the standard specification.
 This pidgin plug-in provides support for the LCS protocol which
 it calls SIPE (SIP Exchange).
 .
 This plugin has full support for LCS 2005 and OCS 2007. Partial LCS 2003.
 . 
 The stable version has full support for:  
  o Send/receive messages  
  o Full presence (both sides)  
  o To add/remove/move contacts  
  o TLS/SSL support (port 5061)  
  o Search contacts  
 .
