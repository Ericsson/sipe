Known issues of 1.9.0:

#2968287: Authentication failure in scenario when version of authentication protocol of home Communications Server is 2 (Live Communications Server 2005) and version of authentication protocol in director server is above 2 (Office Communications Server 2007 and above).

Applicability: user account resides on Communications Server 2005
Workaround: explicitly define address of home server in Server[:Port] field on Advanced tab in account configuration.
  Home server address can be observed in logs in SIP/2.0 301 error response in "Contact:" header.
  Logs can be obtained by starting Pidgin in command line with -d flag.
Resolved: in development branch - git commit 494c1e467b13de295a30bcd0981fa7311f218e9a
