version 1.11.0 "Lotus Domino/Calendar & Voice Call" (2010-10-04)
	- Feature #2859239: Voice call support (Jakub Adam)
	  * requires updated versions of libnice, farsight & pidgin
	  * only unencrypted calls as SRTP support is missing in farsight
	- Feature #2945346: Lotus Notes/Domino Calendar integration (pier11):
	  * Sipe can now retrieve calendar data (Meeting schedule/subject/
	    location) from a web-enabled Lotus Domino server and publish it to
	    OCS2007/LCS2005 as availability information.
	  * Example: "Calendar: Currently Busy. Free at 11:30".
	  * Team members (contacts with access level Team) will be able to see
	    information about our current meeting (subject & location) (OCS2007).
	  * First calendar update is scheduled 1 minute after connect,
	  * Subsequent calendar updates happen in 30 minute intervals.
	  * Manual calendar update can be triggered using the following menu:
		   Accounts->{SIPE_ACCOUNT}->"Republish Calendar"
	  * Though Domino integration can work without any additional settings 
	    in account configuration (on Windows), there are options to manually
	    provide Domino Services URL and email address/password if it's
	    different from SIP URI/Password settings on Basic tab.
