- Feature Requests:
  #2823160: Ability to change the "Access Level" setting of a buddy (Team, Company, etc.)
  #2945346: Lotus Notes/Domino Calendar integration.
- Bugs:
  #2834758: (sip-sec-ntlm.c) First NTLM signature check after startup fails

Big Targets:
- libsipe (purple-independent library encapsilating the protocol). Forseeable backends
are Purple, Telepathy, Miranda.
- Telepathy native plugin.
- Voice and Video support.
- Desktop sharing/Live Meeting integration on Windows platform.
- (?) Email notification.
- Refactoring to decouple transport/SIP layer (like has been done in http-conn.c)
from SIP-protocol's extensions in form of XML exchange (most notably presense).
So Sofia-SIP could serve as a backend for SIPE. Or otherwise improve SIPE transport 
layer - timeouts.
(In http-conn.c inputs are XML requests, outputs - XML responces or error codes.
All lower level things like socket read/write operations, HTTP message forming, 
NTLM/etc. authertication are all hidded behind http-conn.h API.
So sip-ews.c client only operate with XML request/responce, it doesn't care what
is underneath transport at all.)
- Update project's site with SIPE features, make better/more complete screenshots,
make page about standards used in SIPE with references, make some form of FAQ page.

Call Control:
- change user state to On Call when line is active and then back
- answer incoming call (logs required)
- (?) work with multiple phone lines (not the first one)
- (?) Call transfer set up, other RCC features from Communicator.
