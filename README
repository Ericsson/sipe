Installing from a distribution repository
=========================================

Many Open Source OS distributions have a ready-made package "pidgin-sipe".
Before trying to compile it from the source code yourself, you should try
to install this package with the standard installation method provided by
your OS.


Do It Yourself I: compiling against "pidgin" package
====================================================

If you already have installed the "pidgin" package from your distribution
repository and want compile pidgin-sipe from source code yourself, then you
need to install the necessary headers first. Depending on your distribution
you'll need to install one of the following packages

	libpurple-dev
	libpurple-devel

For the compilation you'll need to install a C compiler and some of the
following packages

	libtool
	intltool
	libglib2.0-dev
	gettext-devel

Now you should be able to compile the source code with

	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make

If you get errors then you are missing some required package. After
successful compilation you can install pidgin-sipe with:

	su -c "make install"


Do It Yourself II: compiling against self-compiled pidgin
=========================================================

If you have compiled pidgin from source code yourself then you'll have to
specify the correct installation path in configure. Usually pidgin is
installed in /usr/local so the following command should work

	./configure --prefix=/usr/local

The rest of the steps are the same as in the previous section.
